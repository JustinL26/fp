List of Collaborators :

Please make a good faith effort at listing people you discussed any problems with here, as per the course academic integrity policy.  CAs/Prof need not be listed!

Fill in the function definitions below replacing the 

  unimplemented ()

with your code.  Feel free to add "rec" to any function listed to make it recursive. In some cases, you will find it helpful to define auxillary functions, feel free to.

You must not use any mutation operations of OCaml for any of these questions (which we have not taught yet in any case): no arrays, for- or while-loops, references, etc.

(*
	Define a variation on the previous function which before inserting the element verifies that the input list is indeed sorted.  Use the built-in `Base` function invalid_arg	which will raise an exception.	Note that invalid_arg is a function that raises the Invalid_argument exception

	Important: Your invalid_arg function must take this exact string (without quotes):
	"List not sorted" 

	e.g. invalid_arg "List not sorted"

	This is because OUnit2 tests check not only for exception type but also the message. If you don't have the same error message as us, the autograder will fail you.

(*
	Write a sort routine by repeated invocations of remove_max to pull out the largest
	elements one-by-one.  You should never need to invoke `remove_max` on an empty
	list, and you can thus `assert false` (an invariant failure) if the `Error`
	case is ever returned from `remove_max`.  
	This problem shows how we can manually encode the exceptional condition in `
	remove_max` with `Ok`/`Error` but convert it to an actual side effect here
	(the `assert false` will raise an exception if hit).

	Max sort on an empty list should return an empty list, not throw an exception.
	The sorted list should be sorted from smallest to largest string lexicographically

Part II Section 2: Checking validity of a Towers game solution

Towers is a simple puzzle game, for rules and to play the game see
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/towers.html

Here is a description taken from that site:

Your task is to build a tower on every square, in such a way that:
* Each row contains every possible height of tower once
* Each column contains every possible height of tower once
* Each numeric clue describes the number of towers that can be seen if you look into the square from that direction, assuming that shorter towers are hidden behind taller ones. For example, in a 5×5 grid, a clue marked ‘5’ indicates that the five tower heights must appear in increasing order (otherwise you would not be able to see all five towers), whereas a clue marked ‘1’ indicates that the tallest tower (the one marked 5) must come first.
	
Since this assignment is an exercise to become familiar with functional programming, we are going to give appropriate auxiliary functions which will decompose the problem into smaller pieces.  You should be able to compose these short functions to accomplish the ultimate goal of verifying whether a completely-filled grid is a solution based on the clues around the edges.  We will only be verifying the "easy" games which don't leave out any of the clues around the grid edges.
	
Use the List combinators, pipelining, etc. when possible and whenever it improves the readability of the solution.  All but the last function are directly code-able with the List combinators and no `rec`.
As in Part I feel free to write your own helper functions if needed.

If you are unsure on what the requirements of the functions are, look at the test cases we provide.

*)

(* We can represent the tower board itself as a list of lists of ints.  
  See `tower_board_example` in `tests.ml` for an example.

The first task is to determine if a list of lists of integers is "square", i.e. each list is the same length and there are the same number of lists as there are elements in any of the lists. If it is, return Ok(the dimension of the array).  If not, return Error "not square". *)

let square_size (grid: int list list) : (int, string) result =
	unimplemented ()

(* Given a list of integers of length n, determine if the list has exactly one occurrence
	 of each number in 1 .. n in it. Return false if not *)	
let elements_span_range (l : int list) : bool = 
	unimplemented ()

(* Check to see if a towers grid is well-formed, namely
	 1) it is square as per above,
   2) it is at least 1x1 in size (no 0x0 degenerates are allowed)
   2) each row and column spans the range as per above *)
let well_formed_grid (grid : int list list) : bool = 
	unimplemented ()

(* The next six auxiliary functions should only be called on well-formed grids, or rows from well-formed
	 grids, and so you don't need to deal with ill-formed cases there such as 0x0 or non-spanning grid rows.  *)	

(* The lowest level of the validity check for towers requires finding the number of local maxima going down a given row of the grid (i.e. down a list of integers).  Define a function local_max_count to find that value.  *)

let local_max_count (row : int list) : int =  
	unimplemented ()

(* Now we need to apply the above function to each row/column around the grid.  There are many reasonable ways to solve that task, but here we ask you to first write a function verify_left_clues to check the "left side grid" clues only are correct.  For this function the `edge_clues` list is only the left-side clues. *)

let verify_left_clues (grid : int list list) (edge_clues : int list) : bool =
	unimplemented ()

(* In order to check the clues on all four edges, we will rotate the grid counter-clockwise and call the above function at each rotation. 
There many ways we can rotate our grid.  Here we suggest using a combination of transpose (like for a matrix: flip rows and columns), and reflect.  Note you can assume the grid is well-formed.  *)	
let transpose (grid : int list list) : int list list = 
	unimplemented ()

let reflect_vertical_axis (grid : int list list) : int list list =
	unimplemented ()


(* Now it should not be difficult to define a function to rotate the grid counterclockwise *)
let rotate_ccw (grid : int list list) : int list list = 
	unimplemented ()

(* Finally, write a function verify_towers_solution which given a grid and the clues all around the grid, verifies that the solution is correct with respect to the clues: the grid is well-formed as per above, and the clues are all satisfied by the solution.  
The clues are a list of lists, the first element of the list is the edge_clues for the original board orientation, and the subsequent lists correspond to clues for successive rotations of the grid. 
If either the grid is ill-formed or the clues are not all satisfied, return false.  *)
